# Naive-Bayes-with-Bag-of-Words
Naive Bayes with Bag of Words implementation from scratch. 

A dataset of tweets and its emotion label is used in this implementation.

First data cleaning was performed to reformat the words and remove words such "the" and other since it's meaningless in this context.

This is an $n$ label Naive bayse, but 2 labels were used due to lunsufficint distribution of data and labels.
